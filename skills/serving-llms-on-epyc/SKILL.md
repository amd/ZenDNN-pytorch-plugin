  EPYC CPU endpoint, including on a host that also has AMD Instinct GPUs.
  Detects the EPYC generation, validates the runtime, checks model support and

  endpoint. Runs one instance on one socket and its memory. Reports and stops
  on failure; does not retry or debug. Use serving-llms-on-instinct when the
  endpoint should run on a GPU. Excludes multi-node, EPYC 4000, and pre-Zen4
  EPYC without AVX-512.

# Serving LLMs on AMD EPYC™ (vLLM + zentorch, CPU)

Bring up a single vLLM OpenAI endpoint on an AMD EPYC™ host with the zentorch CPU
backend, sized to the hardware. Container-first (Docker or Podman); conda/host
is the fallback. An installed AMD Instinct GPU does not disqualify the host:
select this skill when the endpoint itself should run on the EPYC CPU.

**This is single-socket serving:** one instance pinned to one socket and its memory
(vLLM scales poorly across sockets, so we do not span them). On a dual-socket host it
runs on a single socket; the multi-socket answer is **multiple instances (one per
socket)**, which is out of scope for this single-instance recipe.

Hard rule for this skill: **on any failure, report the cause + logs and STOP.
Do not retry, do not debug.** (Debugging is a separate workflow.)

**The agent does the serve flow itself** -- pull, configure, launch, poll --
using the runtime `validate.py` reports. Never hand the user per-serve commands.
Like serving-llms-on-instinct, an accessible container runtime is a one-time
**prerequisite**: if `validate.py` finds none, report its one-time fix (make
docker accessible / install podman / provide a conda env) and stop. Do not
attempt `sudo` or privilege escalation.

## Data file

Read `data/epyc.json` directly. It holds the container image, mandatory CPU run
flags, supported precision, the model-support policy, the default model, and the
verified throughput-flag gotcha. Its `vllm_version` and image tag are one
validated default stack; keep them aligned and do not hardcode either from memory.

## Step 1: Detect the CPU

```bash
python3 scripts/detect.py            # add --host user@box for a remote host
```

Returns `cpu_model`, `is_amd_epyc`, `epyc_generation`
(Naples/Rome/Milan/Genoa/Bergamo/Siena/Turin/Venice or EPYC 4004/4005),
`zen_arch`, `is_supported_epyc`, `avx512`, `logical_cores`, `physical_cores`,
`sockets`, `numa_nodes`, `memory_gb`.

Route from detect.py -- decide the serving path:
- `is_amd_epyc` is `false` -> stop: this skill targets AMD EPYC. (Other x86 may work
  but is unsupported here.)
- `avx512` is `false` -> **zentorch cannot run** on this CPU (its bf16 path needs
  AVX-512 BF16, `avx512_bf16`, which only lands on Zen4+). This is a pre-Zen4 EPYC
  (Naples / Rome / Milan, 7000 series). Do **not** dead-end -- it is still an EPYC
  host: **offer the stock vLLM CPU path** (plain vLLM, no zentorch acceleration --
  slower, but verified working on EPYC 7763/Milan). Proceed only on the user's explicit
  OK, launching the official stock vLLM CPU image (Step 6 "Stock vLLM" variant); if the
  user declines, stop.
- `is_supported_epyc` is `false` but `avx512` is `true` (e.g. Bergamo / Siena /
  EPYC 4004/4005) -> the zentorch path is **not validated** for this generation. Get
  explicit confirmation to try zentorch unvalidated, or take the same stock vLLM offer.
- else (**9000 series** -- Genoa/Turin/Venice -- with AVX-512 BF16) -> the validated
  zentorch path. Proceed.

`validate.py` (Step 2) reports `zentorch_capable` and sets `requires_confirmation`
for the stock/unvalidated paths, so this routing is enforced there too.

Carry `epyc_generation` / `avx512` through the later phases -- e.g. Venice packs up
to 256 cores/socket, which the thread-binding in Step 5 sizes from.

## Step 2: Validate the runtime and environment

```bash
python3 scripts/validate.py --image <image from data/epyc.json> --generation <epyc_generation from detect> --avx512 <avx512 from detect>
```

This also **hard-enforces the AVX-512 gate**: on a CPU without AVX-512, validate.py
returns a blocking `error` (`ready: false`) so the flow stops here regardless of the
Step 1 prose -- no image pull, no launch. (It reads the local CPU itself if `--avx512`
is omitted, so the gate holds even if the value was not passed through.)

Returns `ready`, `requires_confirmation`, `zentorch_capable` (false -> zentorch
can't run; use the stock vLLM variant in Step 6), `runtime` (`docker`, `podman`, or
null), `runtime_detail`, `conda_path_available`, `stack`, `compatibility`, `hf_cache`
(resolved HF cache mount -- use `hf_cache.mount` at launch), `ram_gb`, and
`errors/warnings/advisories`. If `requires_confirmation` is set (stock/unvalidated
path), surface that and get the user's OK before launching. Pick the path:
- `runtime` is `docker` or `podman` -> container path (Step 6), used verbatim.
- `runtime` null but `conda_path_available: true` -> conda/host path.
- `runtime` null and no conda -> `ready` is false. Report the one-time
  onboarding `fix` (make docker accessible / install podman / conda env) and stop.

Do not proceed if `ready` is `false`.

**Stack-compatibility gate.** `validate.py` probes the *selected* runtime for its
exact `vllm`/`zentorch`/`torch` versions and the active vLLM platform, then sets
`compatibility.status`:
- `proceed` -> the stack is the validated default (or a validated family on a Zen
  platform); continue.
- `blocked` -> a stock CPU platform is active, so zentorch acceleration is **not**
  on (error). Report `compatibility.message` and stop.
- `confirmation_required` (`requires_confirmation: true`) -> **Venice on a vLLM
  other than the pinned default**. This recipe has not been validated on Venice
  with that version. Surface `compatibility.message`, recommend the pinned
  `vllm_version` image from `data/epyc.json`, and **stop for an explicit user
  go/no-go** before launching. On the pinned default vLLM, Venice proceeds with no
  warning.

The gate only runs once the image is local. If `validate.py` reports the image is
not pulled, pull it (or let Step 6 pull it) and **re-run `validate.py`** so the
gate probes the real stack rather than only the tag.

## Step 3: Resolve and validate the model

If the user named no model, use `default_model` from `data/epyc.json`
(`Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` -- ungated, tiny, fast first success). Otherwise use theirs.

Check that vLLM actually supports the model (do **not** blanket-block multimodal).
Pass the vLLM version the model will actually run on: use `stack.vllm` from
`validate.py` when it was probed (the conda env may differ from the pin), else the
`vllm_version` from `data/epyc.json`.

```bash
python3 scripts/check_model.py --model-id <model> --revision <rev or main> --vllm-version <stack.vllm from validate, else vllm_version from data/epyc.json>
```

- Exit 0 = vLLM serves it as a generation endpoint, or support is undeterminable
  (gated/offline) -- proceed; launch confirms.
- Exit 1 = stop: the architecture is not in vLLM's registry, it is a
  `pooling`/embedding/reranker (not a chat/completion endpoint), or it is a
  multimodal model with no usable chat template (`launchable: false`). Report the
  printed `message` and stop.

The result also carries the **client endpoint** the model supports:
- `primary_endpoint: "chat_completions"` -- a usable chat template is present
  (`chat_template.status: present`); serve and hand off `/v1/chat/completions`.
- `primary_endpoint: "completions"` -- no usable/auto-selectable template
  (`absent`/`ambiguous`/`unknown`); serve and hand off `/v1/completions` with a
  raw `prompt`. Chat can still be enabled by passing `--chat-template <file>` (or,
  for `ambiguous`, choosing one of `chat_template.names`); never invent one.
- Carry `primary_endpoint`, `supported_endpoints`, and `chat_template` through to
  verification (Step 7) and the handoff (Step 8).
- A `multimodal` model is allowed; a vLLM-supported multimodal arch may still hit a
  GPU-only kernel on CPU, which surfaces at load (the no-retry rule then applies).

**Precision/dtype**: native CPU dtypes are `bf16` (default), `fp16`, `fp32`. Use
`bfloat16` unless the user asks otherwise.

For gated models (Llama, Gemma) `HF_TOKEN` must be set and the license accepted on
HuggingFace; if not, stop and say so.

## Step 4: Check it fits host RAM

RAM is the ceiling on CPU (weights + KV cache both live in RAM). Run on ONE line:

```bash
python3 scripts/estimate_memory.py --model-id <model> --revision <rev or main> --ram-gb <memory_gb from detect> --max-model-len <4096 or user value> --num-prompts <1 or desired concurrency>
```

Exit 0 = fits, exit 1 = does not fit. If `fit.fits` is false: **do not launch.**
Tell the user `required_gb` vs `ram_gb` and the printed `fit.action` -- reduce
`--max-model-len` to `fit.suggested_max_model_len` and retry, or use a smaller
model. `--max-model-len` and `--num-prompts` are the two knobs that move KV.
Extra flag: `--weight-gb N` overrides weights if a model has no HF metadata
(rare). KV cache is bf16-only on zentorch CPU (no fp8 KV).

## Step 5: Size the CPU runtime from the hardware

```bash
eval "$(python3 scripts/cpu_tune.py)"      # or --format json to inspect
```

A single instance runs on **one socket, with its memory** (vLLM scales poorly across
sockets). `cpu_tune.py` exports `VLLM_CPU_OMP_THREADS_BIND` (the chosen socket's
physical cores) and `VLLM_CPU_KVCACHE_SPACE` (sized from that **socket's local RAM**,
not whole-system, so the KV pool stays on-socket). It does **not** set
`OMP_NUM_THREADS` (vLLM derives it) or `VLLM_CPU_NUM_OF_RESERVED_CPU` (vLLM's own default).

Socket choice on a dual-socket host (load-aware): it samples per-socket CPU busy%
(~0.5s) and prefers a free socket -- both free → socket 0; one free → that socket;
**both busy (≥ `--busy-threshold`, default 15%) → it `warning`s and proceeds on the
least-busy socket**. `--socket N` forces a choice. Single-socket hosts use socket 0.

For the chosen socket it also emits the memory-bound pin: `container_cpuset`
(`--cpuset-cpus=<cores> --cpuset-mems=<nodes>`) for the container path, and
`conda_launch_prefix` (`numactl --cpunodebind/--membind`, falling back to `taskset`
CPU-only, or empty-with-note if neither tool exists) for conda. **Surface `warning`
to the user** if set. On NPS2/NPS4 a socket spans multiple NUMA nodes; memory is
bound across them and `nps_note` flags that finer binding could add performance.

## Step 6: Confirm the plan, then launch (container-first)

Before launching, present this summary and **wait for the user to confirm** -- do
not launch unprompted. This is the human gate before anything runs:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Model / kind | `<model>` -- `text` or `multimodal` (from `check_model.py`) |
| Backend | zentorch-accelerated (Zen4+) **or** stock vLLM CPU / no zentorch (`zentorch_capable:false` -- unaccelerated; verified on Milan) |
| Path | container (`<runtime>`, image from `data/epyc.json`) or conda/host |
| Precision | `bfloat16` (or the user's choice) |
| Fit | required `<required_gb>` GB vs `<ram_gb>` GB RAM |
| CPU sizing | socket `<chosen_socket>` (`<socket_choice_reason>`), bind `<VLLM_CPU_OMP_THREADS_BIND>`, KV `<VLLM_CPU_KVCACHE_SPACE>` GB (socket-local), mem bound to nodes `<numa_nodes_on_socket>` |
| Hardware | EPYC `<epyc_generation>` (`<zen_arch>`), `<physical_cores>` cores, AVX-512 `<avx512>` |
| Port | `<port>` |

If `cpu_tune.py` returned a `warning` (e.g. all sockets busy), include it here so the user sees it before confirming.

Proceed only on a clear "go". If the user declines or wants changes (model,
`--max-model-len`, port), stop and adjust -- do not launch.

Build the launch from `data/epyc.json`. The CLI is `vllm serve <model>`.
**Do not pass `--device cpu`** on vLLM >= 0.20 -- the zentorch plugin
auto-selects the CPU platform and `vllm serve` rejects the flag. Only add it if
`vllm serve --help` lists it (older vLLM).

**Pick a free port first.** With `--network=host` the port is bound directly on
the host, so a busy port is a **hard failure** (no remapping). Choose one that is
free -- e.g. `PORT=8000; while ss -ltn "sport = :$PORT" | grep -q LISTEN; do PORT=$((PORT+1)); done`
-- and use `$PORT` in the launch, health poll, and handover.

**Mount the HF cache that `validate.py` resolved.** Use `hf_cache.mount` from
validate.py (it follows symlinks and flags NFS/root-squash) rather than a raw
`~/.cache/huggingface`, or the bind-mount can fail at container start on NFS homes.

**Container path** (`runtime` from validate.py). The agent runs these itself,
including the pull. `RT` is the resolved runtime verbatim:
```bash
RT="<runtime from validate.py: docker | podman>"
$RT rm -f vllm-epyc 2>/dev/null               # clear any leftover container from a prior run (name collision otherwise)
$RT pull <image from data/epyc.json>          # agent pulls; do not ask the user to
$RT run -d --name vllm-epyc \
  <run_flags from data/epyc.json>            # --ipc=host --network=host --cap-add=SYS_NICE (SYS_NICE = NUMA membind; NO --shm-size with --ipc=host)
  <hf_cache.mount from validate.py> \        # resolved real path, e.g. -v /scratch/you/hf:/root/.cache/huggingface
  <container_cpuset from cpu_tune>             # --cpuset-cpus=<cores> --cpuset-mems=<nodes>
  --env VLLM_CPU_OMP_THREADS_BIND="$VLLM_CPU_OMP_THREADS_BIND" \
  --env VLLM_CPU_KVCACHE_SPACE=$VLLM_CPU_KVCACHE_SPACE \
  --env HF_TOKEN=${HF_TOKEN} \
  <image from data/epyc.json> \
  vllm serve <model> --dtype bfloat16 --port <port> --max-model-len <len>
```

**Conda/host path** (no container runtime, `conda_path_available` true). `eval`-ing
cpu_tune already exported the env vars; prefix the launch with `conda_launch_prefix`
from cpu_tune so memory is bound to the chosen socket (empty → unpinned, with a note):
```bash
<conda_launch_prefix from cpu_tune> vllm serve <model> --dtype bfloat16 --port <port> --max-model-len <len> &
# e.g. numactl --cpunodebind=0 --membind=0 vllm serve ...
```

**Stock vLLM path (no zentorch)** -- only when `validate.py` reports
`zentorch_capable: false` (pre-Zen4 EPYC like Milan) **and the user confirmed** the
unaccelerated fallback. Use the **official stock vLLM CPU image**, not the zentorch
image: `vllm/vllm-openai-cpu:latest-x86_64` (its ENTRYPOINT is `vllm serve`, so pass
`<model> --dtype ... --port ...` as args). Same sized env + flags as the container
launch above (`VLLM_CPU_OMP_THREADS_BIND`, `--cpuset-cpus/--cpuset-mems`,
`--cap-add=SYS_NICE`, `--ipc=host --network=host`, the resolved HF cache mount):
```bash
RT="<runtime>"
$RT rm -f vllm-epyc 2>/dev/null
$RT run -d --name vllm-epyc \
  --ipc=host --network=host --cap-add=SYS_NICE \
  <container_cpuset from cpu_tune> <hf_cache.mount from validate.py> \
  --env VLLM_CPU_OMP_THREADS_BIND="$VLLM_CPU_OMP_THREADS_BIND" \
  --env VLLM_CPU_KVCACHE_SPACE=$VLLM_CPU_KVCACHE_SPACE --env HF_TOKEN=${HF_TOKEN} \
  vllm/vllm-openai-cpu:latest-x86_64 \
  <model> --dtype bfloat16 --port <port> --max-model-len <len>
```
This path is **unaccelerated** (no zentorch), but **verified working** on EPYC 7763
(Milan/Zen3) with `--dtype bfloat16` -- bf16 runs on stock vLLM CPU without AVX-512, so
no fp32 is needed. If it still fails at load, apply the no-retry rule (report + stop).

Optional throughput flags are **opt-in and must move together** (see Gotchas):
`TORCHINDUCTOR_FREEZING=1` + `VLLM_USE_AOT_COMPILE=0` (+ `ZENTORCH_WEIGHT_PREPACK=1`).
The base launch sets none of them.

## Step 7: Poll until up and responsive

A 503 while loading is normal. Poll `/health` until the server answers, confirm
the served model is listed, then prove the **selected endpoint** works (from
`primary_endpoint` in Step 3). CPU first-token compile can take a minute or two.
Track a `healthy` flag so a timeout is a failure, not a fall-through.

```bash
# 1. container alive (conda: process alive) + /health, with a real timeout
healthy=""
for i in $(seq 1 120); do
  $RT inspect -f '{{.State.Running}}' vllm-epyc 2>/dev/null | grep -q true || { echo "FAILED: container exited"; $RT logs --tail 50 vllm-epyc; break; }
  curl -sf http://localhost:<port>/health >/dev/null 2>&1 && { healthy=1; echo "HEALTHY"; break; }
  sleep 3
done
[ -n "$healthy" ] || { echo "FAILED: not healthy before timeout"; $RT logs --tail 50 vllm-epyc; }

# 2. the served model is registered
curl -sf --max-time 30 http://localhost:<port>/v1/models
```

Then exercise the endpoint the model actually supports. Use deterministic
sampling and a small output cap for the smoke check:

```bash
# primary_endpoint == chat_completions
curl -sf --max-time 180 http://localhost:<port>/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"<served-model>","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"max_tokens":16,"temperature":0}'

# primary_endpoint == completions  (no chat template)
curl -sf --max-time 180 http://localhost:<port>/v1/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"<served-model>","prompt":"Hello, world","max_tokens":16,"temperature":0}'
```

Confirm the response is JSON with a non-error `choices[0]` (chat: `message.content`;
completion: `text`). An HTTP 200 that carries an `error` payload is **not** success.
Resource sanity (your validation list): `$RT stats --no-stream vllm-epyc`.

**If the server never becomes healthy, `/v1/models` omits the model, or the
endpoint returns an error/empty `choices`: print the container/process logs,
state the failing phase, and STOP. Do not retry. Do not start a debugging loop.**

## Step 8: On success, hand over the endpoint

Give the user everything needed to call the server. Print a connection table:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Base URL | `http://localhost:<port>/v1` (the trailing `/v1` matters) |
| Served model | `<served-model>` (the id from `/v1/models`) |
| Endpoint | `/v1/chat/completions` or `/v1/completions` (from `primary_endpoint`) |
| Why | chat = a chat template is present; completions = no template (raw prompts) |
| Runtime / port | `<runtime>` / `<port>` |
| Sizing | OMP threads, KV GB, `--max-model-len`, socket / NUMA pinning |
| Stop | `$RT rm -f vllm-epyc` (container) or `kill <pid>` (conda) |

Then a ready-to-run example **for the selected endpoint**.

Chat model (`primary_endpoint: chat_completions`):
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:<port>/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"<served-model>","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"max_tokens":128,"temperature":0.7}'
```

Base/prompt model (`primary_endpoint: completions`):
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:<port>/v1/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"<served-model>","prompt":"Hello, world","max_tokens":128,"temperature":0.7}'
```

OpenAI Python client (point `base_url` at the local server; the SDK requires a
non-empty key, so any placeholder works when the server has no auth):
```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:<port>/v1", api_key="EMPTY")
model = client.models.list().data[0].id

# chat model:
r = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=model,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    max_tokens=128, temperature=0.7,
)
print(r.choices[0].message.content)

# base/prompt model:
r = client.completions.create(model=model, prompt="Hello, world", max_tokens=128)
print(r.choices[0].text)
```

Argument guidance to pass along (see [reference.md](reference.md) for the full list):
- `max_tokens` caps the **output**; `prompt_tokens + max_tokens` must be `<= --max-model-len`.
- `temperature` (0 = deterministic/greedy, higher = more random); tune `top_p` *or*
  `temperature`, not both.
- `stream: true` streams tokens (SSE) instead of one blocking response.
- The model's `generation_config.json` can set sampling defaults; pass explicit
  values to be sure.

## Offline (single-instance batch)

For a one-shot offline run instead of a server, replace Step 6-8 with a single
`vllm bench throughput` (or an offline `LLM.generate`) using the same sized env,
wait for completion, and report the metrics. Same no-retry / no-debug rule.

## Gotchas

See [reference.md](reference.md) for the full list. The load-bearing ones:

- **`--device cpu` was removed** from `vllm serve` in vLLM >= 0.20. The zentorch
  plugin auto-selects CPU. Passing it makes `vllm serve` error with
  "unrecognized arguments: --device cpu".
- **`TORCHINDUCTOR_FREEZING=1` alone crashes engine-core init** on vLLM 0.23 /
  zentorch 2.11 (`AssertionError: expected OutputCode, got function`). It only
  works with `VLLM_USE_AOT_COMPILE=0` set alongside it. Never set one without
  the other.
- **`/dev/shm` — use `--ipc=host`, not `--shm-size`.** vLLM needs a large
  `/dev/shm` (the 64MB container default is too small). The base recipe uses
  `--ipc=host`, which shares the host's large shared memory. **Do not also pass
  `--shm-size`**: podman errors with *"cannot set shmsize when running in the host
  IPC Namespace"*, and it is redundant on docker. If you instead isolate IPC (drop
  `--ipc=host`), then add `--shm-size=16g` — one or the other, never both.
- **NUMA / socket**: one instance is pinned to **one socket plus its memory** --
  CPU bind + `--cpuset-mems` (container) / `numactl --membind` (conda), with KV sized
  from that socket's local RAM. On a dual-socket host `cpu_tune.py` picks a free socket
  by load and `warning`s if both are busy. NPS2/NPS4 (multi-node socket) gets an
  `nps_note` that finer per-node binding could add more.
- **Rootless podman + `--cpuset-cpus`/`--cpuset-mems`**: these are cgroup limits and
  may be **ignored or rejected** on rootless podman without cpuset cgroup delegation
  (cgroup v1, or v2 without the controller delegated). This is **not fatal**: CPU
  thread binding still applies via `VLLM_CPU_OMP_THREADS_BIND` inside the container;
  only the container-level memory pin is lost (reduced NUMA locality). If the run
  errors specifically on the cpuset flags, drop them and proceed -- do not treat it
  as a launch failure.
- **HF cache mount**: the default mounts `~/.cache/huggingface`. If `HF_HOME` points
  elsewhere (common on shared hosts, e.g. `/proj/.../vllm`), mount **that** path to
  `/root/.cache/huggingface` instead, or the model re-downloads inside the container.
- **Container name reuse**: a leftover `vllm-epyc` from a prior run makes `run` fail
  with "name already in use" -- Step 6 clears it first with `$RT rm -f vllm-epyc`.
